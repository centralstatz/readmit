Used `rename_files(\"hsr_example\", \"hsr_mock_reports\")` to rename the function to be more explicit. Changed all required areas to accomodate change.  # 11/5/2025  * Initialized package by creating repo here: https://github.com/centralstatz/readmit * Then created _New Folder from Git_ in Positron, cloning that repo * Then used `usethis::create_package(getwd())` to initialize package template * Added this file `DEVNOTES.md` to `.Rbuildignore` * Ran `usethis::use_r(\"hsr_extract_coefficients\")` to create the packages first function, which extracts the list of model coefficients from a CMS Hospital Specific Report (HSR) for a specified cohort. Added argument checks. * Used `devtools::load_all()` to test it (works on locally downloaded report). * Did initial `devtools::check()` and got various warnings/notes, which is expected because nothing was configured yet. * Edited the `DESCRIPTION` file (with possibly to change over time as package evolves), and added MIT license with `usethis::use_mit_license()` * Added `roxygen2` documentation to function. Used `devtools::document()` to document it. Added `\\dontrun` to roxygen for function as example doesn't work yet. Need to put external data in the package. * Still have warning/note as I haven't declared dependencies, so will do that soon."},{"path":"https://centralstatz.github.io/readmit/LICENSE.html","id":null,"dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"MIT License","title":"MIT License","text":"Copyright (c) 2025 readmit authors Permission hereby granted, free charge, person obtaining copy software associated documentation files (“Software”), deal Software without restriction, including without limitation rights use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, /sell copies Software, permit persons Software furnished , subject following conditions: copyright notice permission notice shall included copies substantial portions Software.
