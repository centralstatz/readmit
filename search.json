Added argument checks. * Used `devtools::load_all()` to test it (works on locally downloaded report). * Did initial `devtools::check()` and got various warnings/notes, which is expected because nothing was configured yet. * Edited the `DESCRIPTION` file (with possibly to change over time as package evolves), and added MIT license with `usethis::use_mit_license()` * Added `roxygen2` documentation to function. Used `devtools::document()` to document it. Added `\\dontrun` to roxygen for function as example doesn't work yet. Need to put external data in the package. * Still have warning/note as I haven't declared dependencies, so will do that soon."},{"path":"https://centralstatz.github.io/readmit/LICENSE.html","id":null,"dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"MIT License","title":"MIT License","text":"Copyright (c) 2025 readmit authors Permission hereby granted, free charge, person obtaining copy software associated documentation files (“Software”), deal Software without restriction, including without limitation rights use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, /sell copies Software, permit persons Software furnished , subject following conditions: copyright notice permission notice shall included copies substantial portions Software.

Individual discharges assigned adjusted readmission risk (based clinical history), get aggregated hospital-level score compared peer groups penalty determination. Specifically, random-intercept logistic regression model built cohort (see methodology) serves basis two (2) readmission risks assigned discharge: Predicted: Adjusted patient-specific clinical factors plus hospital-specific effect (random intercept term) Expected: Adjusted patient-specific clinical factors plus hospital-average effect quantities aggregated across discharges ratio taken form Excess Readmission Ratio (ERR), used cohort-specific comparison metric. Thus, comparative measure likely patients readmitted hospital versus average hospital, given hospital's clinical characteristics.","code":""},{"path":"https://centralstatz.github.io/readmit/reference/hsr_readmission_risks.html","id":"ref-examples","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Examples","title":"Compute discharge-level readmission risks in a Hospital-Specific Report (HSR) — hsr_readmission_risks","text":"","code":"# Access a report my_report <- hsr_mock_reports(\"FY2025_HRRP_MockHSR.xlsx\")  # Compute readmission risks for HF discharges hf_risks <- hsr_readmission_risks(my_report, \"HF\") hf_risks #> # A tibble: 25 × 3 #>    `ID Number` Predicted Expected #>          <int>     <dbl>    <dbl> #>  1           1    0.258    0.264  #>  2           2    0.186    0.192  #>  3           3    0.184    0.189  #>  4           4    0.188    0.193  #>  5           5    0.0857   0.0885 #>  6           6    0.133    0.138  #>  7           7    0.110    0.113  #>  8           8    0.183    0.188  #>  9           9    0.163    0.168  #> 10          10    0.179    0.184  #> # ℹ 15 more rows  # Compute the ERR from scratch hf_risks |>  dplyr::summarize(    Discharges = dplyr::n(),    Predicted = mean(Predicted),    Expected = mean(Expected),    ERR = Predicted / Expected  ) #> # A tibble: 1 × 4 #>   Discharges Predicted Expected   ERR #>        <int>     <dbl>    <dbl> <dbl> #> 1         25     0.159    0.164 0.971   # Check that this matches the report table hsr_extract_cohort_summary(my_report) |>  dplyr::select(   dplyr::matches(      paste0(        \"^Measure|\",        \"^Number of Eligible Discharges|\",        \"^Predicted|\",        \"^Expected|\",        \"^Excess\"      )    )  ) #> # A tibble: 6 × 5 #>   `Measure [a]` `Number of Eligible Discharges [b]` Predicted Readmission Rate…¹ #>   <chr>                                       <dbl>                        <dbl> #> 1 AMI                                             2                       0.181  #> 2 COPD                                           18                       0.165  #> 3 HF                                             25                       0.159  #> 4 Pneumonia                                      32                       0.142  #> 5 CABG                                           NA                      NA      #> 6 THA/TKA                                        45                       0.0350 #> # ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​`Predicted Readmission Rate [d]` #> # ℹ 2 more variables: `Expected Readmission Rate [e]` <dbl>, #> #   `Excess Readmission Ratio (ERR) [f]` <dbl>"},{"path":"https://centralstatz.github.io/readmit/reference/pdc_read.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Import datasets from the Provider Data Catalog (PDC) — pdc_read","title":"Import datasets from the Provider Data Catalog (PDC) — pdc_read","text":"Explore import datasets directly CMS Provider Data Catalog (PDC). pdc_topics(): Retrieves list topics (subcategories) data available pdc_datasets(): Retrieves identifiers, names, descriptions, metadata associated datasets (optionally specified) topics pdc_read(): Imports full dataset given identifier (datasetid). found pdc_datasets().","code":""},{"path":"https://centralstatz.github.io/readmit/reference/pdc_read.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Import datasets from the Provider Data Catalog (PDC) — pdc_read","text":"","code":"pdc_read(datasetid, ...)  pdc_datasets(topics = NULL)  pdc_topics()"},{"path":"https://centralstatz.github.io/readmit/reference/pdc_read.html","id":"arguments","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Arguments","title":"Import datasets from the Provider Data Catalog (PDC) — pdc_read","text":"datasetid dataset identifier (e.g., pdc_datasets()) ...
