# readmit

The goal of `readmit` is to make components of navigating, managing, and
analyzing hospital readmissions easier and more transparent. Ultimately,
keeping patients out of the hospital.

## Installation

You can install the development version of readmit from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("centralstatz/readmit")
```

# Background

A *readmission* occurs when a patient is admitted to the hospital,
again, after they were recently discharged (where 30 days is the typical
time frame used between hospitalizations). First and foremost, it is an
obvious burden to patients for multiple reasons (i.e., psychologically,
financially, etc.).

Additionally, hospitals across the United States are
[penalized](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/hrrp/methodology) by
the [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
(CMS)](https://www.cms.gov/) on an annual basis in what is called the
[Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program
(HRRP)](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/prospective-payment-systems/acute-inpatient-pps/hospital-readmissions-reduction-program-hrrp).
In this program, up to 3% of Medicare reimbursement is witheld from
hospitals for the duration of a [fiscal
year](https://www.usa.gov/federal-budget-process) depending on the
volume of [excess
readmissions](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/hrrp/measures#:~:text=Planned%20Readmission%20Algorithm.-,Excess%20Readmission%20Ratio,-The%20excess%20readmission)
in [select patient
populations](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality/value-based-programs/hospital-readmissions#:~:text=What%20measures%20are%20included%20in%20the%20Hospital%20Readmissions%20Reduction%20Program%3F)
during a preceding [performance
period](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/hrrp/resources).
Readmissions also show up in other payer contracts, such as commericial
insurers. Thus, it is a key area of focus for hospitals and part of the
general measure of overall health of clinical and financial operations.

Typically, cross-functional teams are deployed within health systems to
monitor and develop initiatives, interventions, and overall strategy to
manage and prevent readmissions. This includes things like care
coordination and patient outreach, as well as how to incorporate
technology such as predictive analytics to identify high-risk patients
and prevent readmissions before they occur.

## The Problems

The issues in doing this flawlessly are multi-factorial, but we’ll list
a few that we see relevant to this package:

- **Reporting lineage**: It is often difficult to have seamless line of
  sight and reconcile hospital-wide metrics (e.g., overall readmission
  rates, penalty amounts, etc.) down to individual patients and their
  associated impact. There are many reasons for this: some may be
  technical (e.g., reporting tools, data collection, systems/personnel
  constraints), but some are due to complexities of hospital operations:
  varying definitions of metrics (e.g., how do we define readmissions?),
  diverse patient populations (e.g., which patients should/should not be
  included in the rates?), differential impact on outcomes (e.g., only
  Medicare patients contribute to the penalty but the hospital cares
  about readmissions for all patients).  

- **Payor Contracts/Reimbursement**: Readmissions have different
  implications depending on whose paying for the service (among other
  things). It is difficult to disentangle and account for these nuances
  (especially in reporting/metrics) when developing readmission
  prevention strategies while optimizing financial health.  

- **Oversaturation of research**: Readmissions has a [large body of
  research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=predicting+readmissions).
  As a result, hospitals are thrown all kinds of “evidence” about how
  they should prevent readmissions, but it’s difficult to confidently
  translate and distill that to a localized, optimized, actionable
  program for any one hospital, especially when it’s conflicting.  

- **Over-reliance of risk tools**: Especially in the hype of AI, machine
  learning (ML), etc., there are various vendor platforms and risk tools
  that purport to predict readmissions. The issue comes with how they
  are implemented into clinical workflows. These models may be good
  *statistically*, but must be implemented with intention and
  cross-functional teamwork for them to actually be useful. AI is not
  magic!  

- **Complexity of government programs**: The
  [HRRP](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/prospective-payment-systems/acute-inpatient-pps/hospital-readmissions-reduction-program-hrrp)
  has many moving parts and details that make it difficult to track
  what’s really going on. This includes the timing of the discharges
  that are actually counted in the program relative to when payment
  penalties are applied, the diagnosis codes and claims documentation
  used to identify patients to include, the statistical methodology
  behind the scenes that power program metrics, and the way all of that
  rolls up into a penalty percentage amount administered to the
  hospital, among other things. Each of these details have deep nuances
  that have tangible impact.

  

This package is meant to provide tools to help with components of these
issues. In particular, the current state of the package focuses on the
last item, making it easier to analyze information related to the
[HRRP](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/prospective-payment-systems/acute-inpatient-pps/hospital-readmissions-reduction-program-hrrp).
Over time, we hope this scope widens.

# Examples

Here are a few ways to use the package.

``` r
library(readmit)
```

## Extracting key dates from the HRRP

An important piece of the
[HRRP](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/prospective-payment-systems/acute-inpatient-pps/hospital-readmissions-reduction-program-hrrp)
is to understand the timelines and dates associated with the program. We
provide built-in datasets to conveniently access these dates (see
[`?hrrp_keydates`](https://centralstatz.github.io/readmit/reference/hrrp_keydates.md)).
For example, `hrrp_performance_periods` provides the date ranges for
discharges that are included in each program year:

``` r
hrrp_performance_periods
#>    ProgramYear  StartDate    EndDate
#> 1         2027 2023-07-01 2025-06-30
#> 2         2026 2021-07-01 2024-06-30
#> 3         2025 2020-07-01 2023-06-30
#> 4         2024 2019-07-01 2019-12-01
#> 5         2024 2020-07-01 2022-06-30
#> 6         2023 2018-07-01 2019-12-01
#> 7         2023 2020-07-01 2021-06-30
#> 8         2022 2017-07-01 2019-12-01
#> 9         2021 2016-07-01 2019-06-30
#> 10        2020 2015-07-01 2018-06-30
#> 11        2019 2014-07-01 2017-06-30
```

And `hrrp_snapshot_dates` provides the date that CMS took the extract of
claims data for each program year:

``` r
hrrp_snapshot_dates
#>   ProgramYear SnapshotDate
#> 1        2027   2025-09-30
#> 2        2026   2024-10-22
#> 3        2025   2023-10-13
#> 4        2024   2022-09-30
#> 5        2023   2021-09-24
#> 6        2022   2020-09-25
#> 7        2021   2019-09-27
#> 8        2020   2018-09-28
#> 9        2019   2017-09-29
```

Or, all of the individual `hrrp_*` datasets are pre-joined in
`hrrp_keydates`:

``` r
hrrp_keydates
#>    ProgramYear PerformanceStartDate PerformanceEndDate PaymentStartDate
#> 1         2027           2023-07-01         2025-06-30       2026-10-01

#> 3         2025           2020-07-01         2023-06-30       2024-10-01

```

### Finding relevant program dates

We can also use the
[`hrrp_get_dates()`](https://centralstatz.github.io/readmit/reference/hrrp_get_dates.md)
function to extract relevant time periods for an inputted date. For
example:

- *“What is the performance period for payments my hospital is currently
  being penalized for?”*

``` r
hrrp_get_dates(Sys.Date(), "performance", discharge = FALSE)
#> # A tibble: 1 × 3
#>   ProgramYear StartDate  EndDate   
#>         <dbl> <chr>      <chr>     
#> 1        2026 2021-07-01 2024-06-30
```

- *“What payment periods did a discharge from 1/1/2022 impact?”*

``` r
hrrp_get_dates(as.Date("2022-01-01"), "payment", discharge = TRUE)
#> # A tibble: 3 × 3
#>   ProgramYear StartDate  EndDate   
#>         <int> <date>     <date>    
#> 1        2026 2025-10-01 2026-09-30
#> 2        2025 2024-10-01 2025-09-30
#> 3        2024 2023-10-01 2024-09-30
```

We can see that not only are the discharges that impact *today’s*
payment reductions multiple years old, but also individual discharges
(and their associated readmissions) can impact the program result for
three (3) years in a row.

## Analyzing hospital reports

[CMS](https://www.cms.gov/) sends out [Hospital-Specific Reports
(HSR)](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/hrrp/reports) each program
year detailing the calculations of the payment reduction for the
upcoming fiscal year (hospitals are given a 1-month period to review and
submit corrections, the dates of which can be accessed with
`hrrp_review_periods`). These reports contain the penalty amount down to
the individual, line-item discharges that were included in the program.
The package functions prefixed like `hsr_*` are meant to be used with
them. For example, we can use the `hsr_discharges` function to extract
discharge-level data for the heart failure cohort included in the
readmission denominator into a clean data frame:

``` r
# Mock report from QualityNet
my_hsr <- hsr_mock_reports("FY2025_HRRP_MockHSR.xlsx")

hsr_discharges(
  file = my_hsr,
  cohort = "HF",
  eligible_only = TRUE
)
#> # A tibble: 25 × 17
#>    `ID Number` MBI         `Medical Record Number` `Beneficiary DOB`
#>          <int> <chr>       <chr>                   <chr>

#>  3           3 9AA9AA9AA99 99999A                  99/99/9999

#>  7           7 9AA9AA9AA99 99999A                  99/99/9999       
#>  8           8 9AA9AA9AA99 99999A                  99/99/9999       
#>  9           9 9AA9AA9AA99 99999A                  99/99/9999       
#> 10          10 9AA9AA9AA99 99999A                  99/99/9999       
#> # ℹ 15 more rows

#> #   `Discharge Destination` <chr>,
#> #   `Unplanned \r\nReadmission within \r\n30 Days (Yes/No) [a]` <chr>, …
```

We could also extract the risk factors for each patient used in the
statistical models developed by CMS to estimate adjusted readmission
risk:

``` r
hsr_discharges(
  file = my_hsr,
  cohort = "HF",
  eligible_only = TRUE,
  risk_factors = TRUE,
  discharge_phi = FALSE

#>  7           7                           12     1                              1

```

We could then choose to extract the actual model coefficients (weights)
that get applied to the patient risk factors:

``` r
hsr_coefficients(
  file = my_hsr,
  cohort = "HF"
)
#> # A tibble: 40 × 2

These tables can be joined together and each patient’s readmission risk
that CMS used can be computed and analyzed. Or, we can use the
[`hsr_readmission_risks()`](https://centralstatz.github.io/readmit/reference/hsr_readmission_risks.md)
function to do this for us:

``` r
hsr_readmission_risks(
  file = my_hsr,
  cohort = "HF"
)
#> # A tibble: 25 × 3
#>    `ID Number` Predicted Expected
#>          <int>     <dbl>    <dbl>
#>  1           1    0.258    0.264

#>  3           3    0.184    0.189 
#>  4           4    0.188    0.193 
#>  5           5    0.0857   0.0885
#>  6           6    0.133    0.138 
#>  7           7    0.110    0.113 
#>  8           8    0.183    0.188 
#>  9           9    0.163    0.168 
#> 10          10    0.179    0.184 
#> # ℹ 15 more rows
```

As you can see, there are many ways to use the information in these
reports to gain insight into readmissions at your hospital. Further
analysis strategies can be explored in the associated vignette:

```

## Importing data from the Provider Data Catalog

[CMS](https://www.cms.gov/) provides access to a large repository of
datasets in the [Provider Data Catalog
(PDC)](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/), which includes, among many
other datasets, readmission measures and HRRP program results for
hospitals around the United States. The package functions prefixed like
`pdc_*` are general functions to explore and import metadata/datasets
straight from the website into clean datasets in `R` (see
[`?pdc_read`](https://centralstatz.github.io/readmit/reference/pdc_read.md)).
For example, we can use
[`pdc_topics()`](https://centralstatz.github.io/readmit/reference/pdc_read.md)
to get the collection of topics seen
[here](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/):

``` r
pdc_topics()
#>  [1] "Dialysis facilities"                   
#>  [2] "Doctors and clinicians"                
#>  [3] "Home health services"                  
#>  [4] "Hospice care"                          
#>  [5] "Hospitals"                             
#>  [6] "Inpatient rehabilitation facilities"   
#>  [7] "Long-term care hospitals"              
#>  [8] "Nursing homes including rehab services"
#>  [9] "Physician office visit costs"          
#> [10] "Supplier directory"
```

Then we can choose a topic (or topics) we want to find datasets for, and
extract their metadata with
[`pdc_datasets()`](https://centralstatz.github.io/readmit/reference/pdc_read.md):

``` r
hospital_data <- pdc_datasets("Hospitals")
hospital_data
#> # A tibble: 67 × 7
#>    datasetid topic     title       description issued     modified   downloadurl

#> 10 jfnd-nl7s Hospitals Complicati… Prospectiv… 2024-07-31 2025-07-16 https://da…
#> # ℹ 57 more rows
```

This result contains information on all datasets included under the
*Hospitals* topic. We can then explore this list to find a dataset we
want to import. For example, we can search the titles of the datasets
relevant to readmissions:

``` r
readmission_data <- 
  hospital_data |>
    dplyr::filter(
      stringr::str_detect(
        title,
        pattern = "(?i)readmission"
      )
    )
readmission_data
#> # A tibble: 1 × 7
#>   datasetid topic     title        description issued     modified   downloadurl
#>   <chr>     <chr>     <chr>        <chr>       <date>     <date>     <chr>      
#> 1 9n3s-kdb3 Hospitals Hospital Re… In October… 2020-12-10 2025-01-08 https://da…
```

Once we find the dataset we want, we can take note of the `datasetid`,
and use the
[`pdc_read()`](https://centralstatz.github.io/readmit/reference/pdc_read.md)
function to import it:

``` r
hrrp_data <- pdc_read(readmission_data$datasetid)
#> Rows: 18510 Columns: 12
#> ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#> Delimiter: ","
#> chr (11): Facility Name, Facility ID, State, Measure Name, Number of Dischar...
#> dbl  (1): Footnote
#> 
#> ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
#> ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

#> 10 MARSHALL MEDICAL C… 010005        AL    READM-30-PN-H… 305                   
#> # ℹ 18,500 more rows
#> # ℹ 7 more variables: Footnote <dbl>, `Excess Readmission Ratio` <chr>,
#> #   `Predicted Readmission Rate` <chr>, `Expected Readmission Rate` <chr>,
#> #   `Number of Readmissions` <chr>, `Start Date` <chr>, `End Date` <chr>
```

And then we can use this dataset for further analysis. For example:

*“How many hospitals in this dataset are located in Wisconsin?”*

``` r
hrrp_data |>
  dplyr::filter(State == "WI") |>
  with(data = _, dplyr::n_distinct(`Facility ID`))
#> [1] 65
```
