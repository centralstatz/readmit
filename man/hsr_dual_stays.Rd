\description{
Parses the discharge-level records from the HSR of patients who were
dually-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid benefits (see details).
}
\details{
In the \href{https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/prospective-payment-systems/acute-inpatient-pps/hospital-readmissions-reduction-program-hrrp}{Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP)},
hospitals' readmission rates are compared against a peer group of "like" hospitals, which determines whether or not they will
get penalized financially.

The peer group allocation done by \href{https://www.cms.gov/}{CMS} is determined by creating hospital groupings based
on the share of Medicare beneficiaries who were also eligible for Medicaid benefits, a marker of socioeconomic status
in the hospital population. \code{hsr_dual_stays()} extracts the list of discharges accounting for the numerator of this ratio.
